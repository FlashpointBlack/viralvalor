2024-07-26 10:00 AM: Now working on M1 step-1: Analyze `EducatorPanel.js`.
Files expected to modify: `cursornotes/03_Frontend_Roadblocks_Refactor/M1_EducatorPanel_Refactoring.md` (to document findings).

**Analysis of `EducatorPanel.js`:**

Read `client/src/components/EducatorPanel.js` (2526 lines).

**Key Responsibilities & Features Identified:**

*   **Presentation Control:** Managing display window, communication (postMessage, custom events, socket), loading encounters, state (active, game ID).
*   **Scenario & Encounter Management:** Fetching/selecting scenarios, fetching/caching encounter data, current encounter state, path/breadcrumb tracking.
*   **Polling System:** Start/end polls, state (running, options), vote counts.
*   **User Management & Interaction:** User lists, XP/Badge awards, instruction management.
*   **Real-time Communication (Socket.IO):** Extensive event handling for polls, users, presentation, chat.
*   **State Management:** Numerous `useState` and `useRef` hooks. `useEffect` for side effects, data fetching, listeners.
*   **UI & Navigation:** Uses `TopHeader`, `EncounterThumbnail`, `MainNavTabs`, `react-router-dom`.
*   **Debugging & Error Handling:** Dedicated utilities, debug panel.
*   **Authentication:** `useAuth`, `useAuth0`.
*   **Modals & Toasts:** `InputModal`, `useToast`.

**Initial Refactoring Thoughts:**

*   **Custom Hooks:** `usePresentationManager`, `useScenarioManagement`, `useEducatorPolls`, `useEducatorUsers`, `useInstructions`.
*   **Child Components:** `PresentationControls`, `ScenarioExplorer`, `EducatorPollDisplay`, `UserManagementPanel`, `InstructionManager`, `EducatorDebugPanel`.
*   **State Management:** Evaluate `useReducer` for complex related state. Context API for deeply shared state post-breakdown.
*   **Prop Drilling:** Expected to be significant; will be addressed by componentization.

2024-07-26 (Placeholder Time): Now working on M1 step-3: Migrate UI to Sub-components.
Files expected to modify: `client/src/components/EducatorPanel.js`, `client/src/components/EducatorPanel/*.js`.
Starting by analyzing interactions with `EncounterDisplay.js` to confirm which sub-components can be migrated without blocking.

**Update 2024-07-26 (Placeholder Time):**
- Verified that `EducatorPollDisplay`, `UserManagementPanel`, and `InstructionManager` are unlikely to require direct changes to `EncounterDisplay.js` for their UI migration from `EducatorPanel.js`. Communication with `EncounterDisplay` (for polls, etc.) is primarily via `postMessage` or socket events orchestrated by `EducatorPanel`.
- **Migrated Poll UI to `EducatorPollDisplay.js`:**
    - Moved JSX for poll status, time, results/bars, and the "Send/End Poll" button from `EducatorPanel.js` into `client/src/components/EducatorPanel/EducatorPollDisplay.js`.
    - Defined necessary props for `EducatorPollDisplay` (e.g., `isPollRunning`, `elapsedSeconds`, `pollOptions`, `voteCounts`, `sendPoll`, `endPoll`, etc.).
    - Included `formatTime` utility within `EducatorPollDisplay.js`.
    - In `EducatorPanel.js`:
        - Imported `EducatorPollDisplay`.
        - Replaced the old poll information JSX with `<EducatorPollDisplay ... />`, passing the required props.
        - Removed the `formatTime` function definition.
        - Removed the "Send/End Poll" button from the general `.poll-controls` div (other buttons like Start/End Presentation and Broadcast/Close Instruction remain in `EducatorPanel.js` within that div).
- This sub-task did not require modifications to `EncounterDisplay.js`.
