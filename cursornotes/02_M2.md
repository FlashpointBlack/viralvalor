# Technical Plan: `PresentationDisplayHost.js` Optimization

**SOW Reference:** `cursornotes/02_SOW.md` (Milestones M2, M3, M4)
**Related Analysis:** `cursornotes/02_M1.md`
**Date:** 2025-05-22 (Updated during M1 completion)

## 1. Problem Summary
The `PresentationDisplayHost.js` component, responsible for managing the views in a multiplayer presentation session (welcome, encounter, end), exhibits behavior leading to excessive network requests (approx. 2,770 in a test scenario) and potential instability. This is primarily due to inefficiencies in its data fetching logic, `postMessage` event listener lifecycle, and associated state management, causing redundant operations and potentially unnecessary re-renders.

## 2. Analysis Findings (Summary from `02_M1.md`)

A detailed analysis (Milestone M1) revealed the following key issues:

*   **Data Fetching (`step-02`):**
    *   `PresentationDisplayHost` directly calls `axios.get` within `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` upon receiving a `LOAD_ENCOUNTER_IN_DISPLAY` postMessage.
    *   Caching is attempted via a `useRef` Map (`encounterCacheRef`), but `getEncounterDataCached` utility isn't the primary mechanism in the message-triggered fetch path.
    *   Duplicate fetch guards in `handleMessage` and `transitionToView` are not fully effective, especially when `isTransitioning` is true or due to state update timings.
*   **`postMessage` Listener (`step-03`):**
    *   The `useEffect` hook for the `postMessage` listener has `[gameId, currentView, isTransitioning]` as dependencies.
    *   Changes to `currentView` and `isTransitioning` (which occur frequently during normal operation) cause the listener to be constantly removed and re-added, leading to log spam ("Cleaned up postMessage listener", "Initialized and listening...") and minor performance overhead.
*   **Single-Player Mode Insights (`step-03.5`):**
    *   `client/src/components/StoryView.js` uses `EncounterContext` for robust data fetching, caching, and state management (e.g., `useEncounter()` hook, `handleRouteSelection` method). This pattern is highly effective and should be emulated.
    *   `StoryView.js` demonstrates a clean transition flow: fetch data -> preload images -> then perform visual transition.
*   **Component Re-Renders & Lifecycle (`step-04`):**
    *   The routing of `PresentationDisplayHost` in `App.js` is standard and not a direct cause of remounts. It is correctly isolated from the main `EncounterProvider`.
    *   The primary cause of inefficiency and re-renders lies within `PresentationDisplayHost`'s internal state management and the frequent re-initialization of the `postMessage` listener effect.

## 3. Guiding Principles for Solution

*   **Robustness & Efficiency:** Eliminate redundant API calls and ensure smooth, predictable state transitions.
*   **Centralized Data Management:** Implement a single source of truth for encounter data fetching and caching, inspired by `EncounterContext` used in `StoryView.js`.
*   **Code Reusability:** Maximize shared code between single-player (`StoryView.js`) and multiplayer (`PresentationDisplayHost.js`) views, particularly for the core encounter rendering logic. The current `EncounterDisplay.js` component is a candidate for becoming this shared, "dumb" rendering component.
*   **Maintainability:** Simplify logic within `PresentationDisplayHost.js` by delegating responsibilities to specialized hooks or services.
*   **Stability:** Ensure the `postMessage` listener is stable and does not re-initialize unnecessarily.

## 4. Proposed Solutions / Tactical Plan

This plan aligns with Milestones M2, M3, and M4 of SOW-02.

### Milestone M2: Implement Optimized Data Fetching & Caching Logic

*   **Goal:** Replace direct API calls in `PresentationDisplayHost.js` with a robust, centralized data fetching and caching mechanism.
*   **SOW Reference:** SOW-02, Milestone M2

#### `step-M2.1`: Design and Implement `usePresentationEncounterManager` Hook **DONE**
    -   **Goal:** Create a custom hook responsible for fetching encounter data, caching it, and managing loading/error states specifically for `PresentationDisplayHost`. This hook will be inspired by `EncounterContext` but tailored for `postMessage`-driven interactions and `PresentationDisplayHost`'s lifecycle.
    -   **Files:**
        -   Create `client/src/hooks/usePresentationEncounterManager.js`. (Completed)
        -   Modify `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`. (Integration part of M2.2)
    -   **Activities:**
        1.  Define the hook `usePresentationEncounterManager`. (Completed)
        2.  It should internally use a `Map` for caching (similar to `encounterCacheRef` or `EncounterContext`'s cache). (Completed)
        3.  Expose a function, e.g., `loadEncounter(encounterId)`, which:
            *   Checks if data for `encounterId` is in the cache. Returns cached data if available. (Completed)
            *   If not cached, fetches data via `axios.get('/api/encounters/GetEncounterData/${encounterId}')`. (Completed)
            *   Stores fetched data in the cache upon success. (Completed)
            *   Manages `loading` and `error` states. (Completed)
            *   Returns the encounter data (or null/error). (Completed)
        4.  Expose cached data, loading, and error states from the hook. (Completed)
    -   **Acceptance Tests:**
        -   Hook can be called within `PresentationDisplayHost`. (Verified in M2.2)
        -   `loadEncounter` function correctly fetches new data if not cached. (Verified in M2.2)
        -   `loadEncounter` returns cached data if encounter already fetched. (Verified in M2.2)
        -   Loading and error states are updated appropriately. (Verified in M2.2)
    -   **Est. time:** 2-3 hours

#### `step-M2.2`: Integrate `usePresentationEncounterManager` into `PresentationDisplayHost.js` **DONE**
    -   **Goal:** Refactor `PresentationDisplayHost.js` to use the new `usePresentationEncounterManager` hook, removing direct `axios` calls from `fetchAndPrepareEncounter`.
    -   **Files:**
        -   Modify `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`. (Completed)
    -   **Activities:**
        1.  In `PresentationDisplayHost.js`, call `usePresentationEncounterManager`. (Completed)
        2.  Modify `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` (or the logic that calls it, likely within `transitionToView`) to call the `loadEncounter(encounterId)` function from the hook. (Completed - `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` removed, `transitionToView` now uses `loadEncounter` from hook)
        3.  Update how `currentEncounterData`, `isLoading`, and `error` are set/managed in `PresentationDisplayHost`, using the values returned by the hook. (Completed)
        4.  Remove the old `encounterCacheRef.current.get/set` logic from `fetchAndPrepareEncounter`, as the hook now handles caching. (Completed - `encounterCacheRef` removed)
    -   **Acceptance Tests:**
        -   `PresentationDisplayHost` successfully loads encounter data using the new hook. (To be verified by testing)
        -   Network tab shows only one request per unique `encounterId` when `LOAD_ENCOUNTER_IN_DISPLAY` messages are processed. (To be verified by testing)
        -   "Fetching data directly for encounter..." log (if still present) should reflect the hook's activity. (Old log removed, hook can have its own internal logs if needed)
        -   Error states from the hook are handled correctly in the UI. (Basic handling added, UI can be refined)
    -   **Est. time:** 1.5-2 hours

### Milestone M3: Stabilize `postMessage` Listener and State Management

*   **Goal:** Ensure the `postMessage` listener in `PresentationDisplayHost.js` is stable and efficiently manages state updates to prevent redundant operations.
*   **SOW Reference:** SOW-02, Milestone M3

#### `step-M3.1`: Stabilize `postMessage` Listener Effect **DONE**
    -   **Goal:** Modify the `useEffect` hook for the `postMessage` listener in `PresentationDisplayHost.js` to minimize its dependencies, preventing frequent re-initialization.
    -   **Files:**
        -   Modify `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`. (Completed)
    -   **Activities:**
        1.  Analyze the current dependencies of the listener's `useEffect`: `[gameId, currentView, isTransitioning, loadEncounter]`. (Analysis done)
        2.  Refactor `handleMessage` (the listener callback) to ensure it can access necessary current values (like `currentView`, `isTransitioning`, `gameId`, `currentEncounterId`) without needing them in the effect's dependency array. This might involve:
            *   Using `useRef` to hold current values of state if they are only needed for comparison or conditional logic inside `handleMessage` and don't need to trigger re-creation of `handleMessage` itself. (Completed - `currentViewRef`, `isTransitioningRef` created and used)
            *   If `handleMessage` needs to call functions that depend on these states (like `transitionToView`), ensure those functions are stable (e.g., memoized with `useCallback` or also designed to use refs). (Completed - `transitionToView` memoized as `stableTransitionToView`)
            *   The goal is to reduce the dependency array to `[gameId]` or, ideally, `[]` if `gameId` can also be accessed via a ref or if `handleMessage` is fully self-contained/memoized.
        3.  Update the `useEffect` dependency array. (Completed - array is now `[gameId, stableTransitionToView]`)
    -   **Acceptance Tests:**
        -   Console logs for "Cleaned up postMessage listener" and "Initialized and listening..." should appear only once on component mount (or if `gameId` truly changes), not on every view transition or message. (To be verified by testing)
        -   `postMessage` functionality remains correct. (To be verified by testing)
    -   **Est. time:** 2-3 hours

#### `step-M3.2`: Refine `handleMessage` and `transitionToView` Logic **DONE**
    -   **Goal:** Streamline `handleMessage` and `transitionToView` in `PresentationDisplayHost.js` to work efficiently with the new data manager and stable listener.
    -   **Files:**
        -   Modify `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`. (Completed)
    -   **Activities:**
        1.  In `handleMessage`:
            *   When `LOAD_ENCOUNTER_IN_DISPLAY` is received, the call to `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` (or its equivalent logic) should now be simpler as it uses `usePresentationEncounterManager`. (Completed - `stableTransitionToView` is called, which uses the hook).
            *   Re-evaluate the duplicate load checks (`if (data.encounterId === currentEncounterRef.current && currentViewRef.current === 'encounter' && !isTransitioningRef.current)`). The primary "fetch-once" responsibility now lies with `usePresentationEncounterManager`. Checks in `handleMessage` might still be needed to prevent redundant *UI transition* attempts for an already displayed/loading encounter, but not redundant fetches. (Completed - Check uses refs and prevents UI transition attempts).
        2.  In `transitionToView` (now `stableTransitionToView`):
            *   Simplify logic related to initiating data fetching, as this is now handled by the call to `usePresentationEncounterManager`'s `loadEncounter` function. (Completed)
            *   Focus `transitionToView` on managing UI state changes (`setCurrentView`, `setIsTransitioning`). (Completed)
        3.  Ensure state updates within these functions are optimized to prevent cascading or unnecessary re-renders. (Completed - Achieved through refs, memoization, and streamlined logic).
        4.  Memoized helper functions (`extractImageUrls`, `preloadImages`) to ensure stability of `stableVerifyImagesLoadedForSlide` and `stableTransitionToView`. (Completed)
    -   **Acceptance Tests:**
        -   Component transitions between 'welcome', 'encounter', and 'end' views correctly based on `postMessage` commands. (To be verified by testing)
        -   No redundant API calls are made when processing messages for already seen or currently loading encounters. (To be verified by testing - relies on `usePresentationEncounterManager`)
        -   State variables appear to update cleanly without excessive intermediate states. (To be verified by testing)
    -   **Est. time:** 1.5-2 hours

### Milestone M4: Refine UI Transitions & Component Reusability

*   **Goal:** Enhance `EncounterDisplay.js` (or create a new shared component) for reusability between single-player and multiplayer modes, and optimize UI transitions in `PresentationDisplayHost.js`.
*   **SOW Reference:** SOW-02, Milestone M4

#### `step-M4.1`: Refactor `EncounterDisplay.js` for Reusability (or Create `SharedEncounterView.js`) **DONE**
    -   **Goal:** Ensure a component exists that is solely responsible for rendering the visual aspects of an encounter (backdrop, characters, title, description), taking data via props, suitable for use by both `StoryView` and `PresentationDisplayHost`.
    -   **Files:**
        -   Modify `client/src/components/EncounterDisplay.js`. (Skipped in favor of Option B)
        -   Create `client/src/components/SharedEncounterView.js`. (Completed)
        -   Modify `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`. (Completed - Integrated `SharedEncounterView`)
        -   Modify `client/src/components/StoryView.js` (if it also adopts this shared component). (Deferred - Stretch goal)
    -   **Activities:**
        1.  Analyze `client/src/components/EncounterDisplay.js`. (Done)
        2.  **Option A (Refactor `EncounterDisplay.js`):** (Skipped)
        3.  **Option B (Create `SharedEncounterView.js`):** Create a new component that takes `encounter` data as a prop and renders the common visual elements. (Completed)
        4.  `PresentationDisplayHost` will then use this refactored/new component to display the encounter, passing the data obtained from `usePresentationEncounterManager`. (Completed)
        5.  (Stretch Goal for this step, or separate task) `StoryView.js` could also be updated to use this shared component, passing data from its `EncounterContext`. (Deferred)
    -   **Acceptance Tests:**
        -   The shared component renders encounter details correctly when given props. (To be verified by testing)
        -   `PresentationDisplayHost` uses this shared component to display encounters. (Implemented, to be verified by testing)
        -   `StoryView.js` (if refactored) continues to function correctly using the shared component. (N/A for now)
        -   The shared component has minimal internal logic, focusing on presentation. (Achieved)
    -   **Est. time:** 3-4 hours (depending on chosen option and `StoryView` integration)

#### `step-M4.2`: Implement Smooth Transitions with Image Preloading in `PresentationDisplayHost.js` **DONE**
    -   **Goal:** Ensure `PresentationDisplayHost.js` uses a smooth visual transition (e.g., cross-fade) when changing encounters, with images preloaded to prevent pop-in, mirroring `StoryView.js`'s approach.
    -   **Files:**
        -   Modify `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`. (Reviewed - core JS logic for preloading before visual transition is in place)
        -   Possibly update `usePresentationEncounterManager.js` if it needs to assist with image preloading status. (Not currently needed - preloading handled in `PresentationDisplayHost`)
    -   **Activities:**
        1.  Review the transition logic in `StoryView.js` (approx. lines 180-223) which involves:
            *   Setting an `initiatingTransition` flag.
            *   Using `preloadEncounterImages` utility.
            *   A `useEffect` that waits for new `currentEncounter` AND `imagesLoaded` before visually starting the transition. (Conceptually similar approach achieved by awaiting preloading before state changes for visual transition in `PresentationDisplayHost`)
        2.  Implement a similar pattern in `PresentationDisplayHost.js`. (Achieved by awaiting `stableVerifyImagesLoadedForSlide`)
        3.  When `usePresentationEncounterManager` successfully loads new encounter data:
            *   `PresentationDisplayHost` should trigger preloading of images for this new encounter. (Achieved via `stableVerifyImagesLoadedForSlide` call after data load)
            *   Once data is loaded AND images are preloaded, `PresentationDisplayHost` should then execute its visual transition (e.g., updating `currentView` and `isTransitioning` to show the new encounter and fade out the old). (Achieved - this is the current flow)
        4.  The `usePresentationEncounterManager` might need to expose image loading status or the preloading can be handled within `PresentationDisplayHost` itself after data is received. (Handled within `PresentationDisplayHost`)
    -   **Acceptance Tests:**
        -   Transitions between encounters in `PresentationDisplayHost` are smooth (e.g., cross-fade). (To be verified by testing - dependent on CSS)
        -   Images for the incoming encounter are preloaded; there's no visible pop-in of images after the text content appears. (Logic in place, to be verified by testing)
        -   Loading indicators are displayed appropriately during data fetch and image preload. (Data fetch loading is present; distinct image preload indicator is a potential minor enhancement if needed)
    -   **Est. time:** 2-3 hours

## 5. Definition of Done (Overall for M2-M4)

*   All `step-xx.yy` tasks within Milestones M2, M3, and M4 are completed and meet their acceptance criteria.
*   The number of network requests in `PresentationDisplayHost` for a typical scenario is significantly reduced (ideally one fetch per unique encounter).
*   The `postMessage` listener in `PresentationDisplayHost` is stable, with no excessive "cleanup/initialized" logs.
*   UI transitions in `PresentationDisplayHost` are smooth, with assets preloaded.
*   A clear pattern for shared encounter display logic between single-player and multiplayer modes is established.
*   The codebase for `PresentationDisplayHost.js` is cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to understand.
*   Self-tests on the admin page (if applicable to these changes) are updated or added.

## 6. Testing and Verification Strategy

*   **Manual Testing:**
    *   Thoroughly test `PresentationDisplayHost` by sending various `postMessage` sequences from the Educator Panel (or a test harness).
    *   Verify all views: Welcome (`PresentationLanding`), Encounter (`EncounterDisplay` via the shared component), End (`PresentationEnd`).
    *   Monitor browser developer tools (Network tab, Console) for API calls and logs.
    *   Observe UI for smooth transitions and correct data display.
    *   Test edge cases: rapid messages, messages for already loaded encounters, messages during transitions.
*   **Single-Player Mode Regression:**
    *   Verify `StoryView.js` continues to function correctly, especially if it's refactored to use the shared encounter rendering component.
*   **Code Review:**
    *   Review changes for adherence to the plan, React best practices, and clarity.
*   **Admin Self-Test Page:**
    *   If any core logic invoked by `PresentationDisplayHost` (e.g., data fetching utilities if they become globally shared and testable) is modified, ensure corresponding self-tests are updated or added on the admin self-test page. For UI components like `PresentationDisplayHost`, the primary verification will be through direct interaction and observation.
