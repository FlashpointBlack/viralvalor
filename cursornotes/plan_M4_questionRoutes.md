# Plan â€“ M4: Question Bank Routes Extraction

### Context / Problem Statement
The monolithic `routes.js` still contains all **question-bank** (quiz/question) endpoints.  To complete the modularisation effort, these endpoints must be migrated into a dedicated `questionRoutes.js` module **without changing any public URLs or behaviour**.

---

## Task Breakdown

### step-01: Inventory existing endpoints  **AUDITED**
- Goal: List every `/question`, `/questions`, or related endpoint in `routes.js` and map HTTP methods, middleware, helper calls.
- Files: `routes.js` (read-only), `cursornotes/plan_M4_questionRoutes.md` (update catalogue)
- Acceptance tests: Add a bullet list under **Endpoints Catalogue** section with method + path.
- Est. time: < 1 h

### step-02: Scaffold `questionRoutes.js`  **AUDITED**
- Goal: Create new Express router, add placeholder 501 handlers and `/health` probe.
- Files: `src/routes/questionRoutes.js` (new), `src/routes/index.js` (add mount)
- Acceptance tests: Admin self-test page shows Question Routes block with all placeholders returning 501.
- Est. time: < 1 h

### step-03: Migrate read-only (GET) endpoints  **AUDITED**
- Goal: Move all GET endpoints (e.g. listing, fetching single question) while ensuring identical JSON output.
- Files: `src/routes/questionRoutes.js`, helper modules as needed
- Acceptance tests: Supertest confirms each GET returns 200 with unchanged schema.
- Est. time: < 1 h

### step-04: Migrate mutating (POST/PUT/DELETE) endpoints  **AUDITED**
- Goal: Migrate create / update / delete question & option endpoints, preserve auth/ACL logic.
- Files: `src/routes/questionRoutes.js`, helpers if refactored
- Acceptance tests: Admin self-test block (added later) passes for these endpoints.
- Est. time: < 1 h

### step-05: Wire router & legacy alias  **AUDITED**
- Goal: Mount `questionRoutes` in `server.js` via `/api/questions`; add compatibility alias in `server.js` if legacy paths exist without prefix.
- Files: `server.js`, `src/routes/questionRoutes.js`
- Acceptance tests: Old paths (if any) continue to work; new `/api/questions/...` works.
- Est. time: < 0.5 h

### step-06: Integration & regression tests  **AUDITED**
- Goal: Extend admin self-test page with "Question Routes (HTTP)" block covering every endpoint.
- Files: `selfTestRoutes.js`, possibly `src/routes/questionRoutes.js`
- Acceptance tests: All tests green in browser; console clear.
- Est. time: < 1 h

### step-07: Clean-up & documentation  **AUDITED**
- Goal: Remove legacy question code from `routes.js`, update API docs/README, ensure `/api/questions/health` documented.
- Files: `routes.js`, `docs/API.md`, `README.md`
- Acceptance tests: `routes.js` no longer contains question logic; docs reflect new path.
- Est. time: < 1 h

*Legacy question-bank endpoints removed from `routes.js`; docs & README updated with `/api/questions/health`.*
