# Milestone M1 (SOW-02) â€“ Analysis & Detailed Plan for `PresentationDisplayHost`

**Status:** DONE
**SOW Reference:** `cursornotes/02_SOW.md` - Milestone M1
**Estimated time:** 3-4 h

## Context / Problem Statement
The `PresentationDisplayHost.js` component is exhibiting behavior that leads to excessive network requests (approx. 2,770 in a test scenario) and potential instability. This is likely due to issues in its data fetching logic, component lifecycle management, and/or `postMessage` handling. This milestone focuses on deeply analyzing the component to understand the root causes and to produce a detailed, actionable technical plan for remediation.

## Task Breakdown

The primary output of this milestone is the creation of the `/cursornotes/02_M2.md` document. The following steps outline the analytical work required to populate that plan.

### step-01: Initial Code Review of `PresentationDisplayHost.js` **DONE**
- **Goal:** Gain a foundational understanding of `PresentationDisplayHost.js` structure, state, props, and primary functionalities.
- **Files to Review:** `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`
- **Activities:**
    - Read through the entire component.
    - Identify main state variables (`useState`).
    - Identify primary effects (`useEffect`) and their current dependencies.
    - Note how props are received and used.
    - Understand the different views/modes the component can render.
- **Est. time:** 45 min - 1 h
- **Output:** Mental model of component structure; initial notes for `/cursornotes/02_M2.md` (Component Overview section).
- **Findings (Recorded from initial review):**
    - **Primary Functionality:** Hosts 'welcome' (`PresentationLanding`), 'encounter' (`EncounterDisplay`), and 'end' (`PresentationEnd`) views, managing transitions.
    - **State Variables (`useState`):**
        - `currentView`: (string) 'welcome', 'encounter', 'end'.
        - `previousView`: (string) For transitions.
        - `isTransitioning`: (boolean) CSS transition flag.
        - `currentEncounterId`: (string/number) ID of encounter.
        - `gameId`: (string) From URL query params.
        - `presenterHostSub`: (string) Auth0 sub for end screen.
    - **Effects (`useEffect`):
        - **URL Query Param Listener (for `gameId`):** Deps: `[location.search]`. Parses `gameId`, resets to 'welcome' if new `gameId`.
        - **`postMessage` Event Listener:** Deps: `[gameId, currentView, isTransitioning]`. Adds/removes `window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage)`. **Observation:** Dependency array is highly suspect for causing frequent listener re-initialization, matching console logs.
    - **Props:** Receives no direct props from `App.js` route. Behavior driven by URL params (`gameId`) and `postMessage` events.
    - **Data Fetching & Caching:**
        - `fetchAndPrepareEncounter()`: Directly fetches via `axios.get("/api/encounters/GetEncounterData/:encounterId")`, logged as "Fetching data directly...". Uses `userSub` in headers. Caches to `encounterCacheRef.current`.
        - `encounterCacheRef`: `useRef` holding a `Map` for caching. `getEncounterDataCached` exists but isn't the primary fetch mechanism called by message handler.
        - `verifyImagesLoadedForSlide()`: Fetches presenter picture for 'end' screen; uses cache for encounter images.
    - **Key Logic Flows:** `gameId` from URL initializes. `postMessage` handler calls `transitionToView`. `transitionToView` calls `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` for 'encounter' view.
    - **Refs for Stale Closures:** `currentEncounterRef`, `gameIdRef` used in `handleMessage`.
    - **Initial Problem Areas Identified:**
        1.  **`postMessage` Listener Re-initialization:** Due to `[gameId, currentView, isTransitioning]` dependencies.
        2.  **Data Fetching Trigger:** `transitionToView` -> `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` on `LOAD_ENCOUNTER_IN_DISPLAY` message.
        3.  **State Updates & Effect Interplay:** Potential for cycles or excessive operations due to interactions between state and effect dependencies.

### step-02: Analyze Data Fetching Mechanisms **DONE**
- **Goal:** Pinpoint how, when, and why `PresentationDisplayHost.js` fetches data, with a focus on the "Fetching data directly for encounter..." logs.
- **Files to Review:** `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`, relevant API utility files if any.
- **Activities:**
    - Locate all direct API calls (e.g., `axios.get`, `fetch`).
    - Determine which `useEffect` hooks or functions trigger these calls.
    - Analyze the conditions (state changes, prop changes) that lead to these fetches.
    - Specifically trace the logic path that logs "Fetching data directly for encounter...".
- **Est. time:** 1 h - 1.5 h
- **Output:** Detailed notes for `/cursornotes/02_M2.md` (Data Fetching Analysis section), including code snippets and suspected problematic patterns.
- **Findings (Recorded from analysis):**
    - **Primary Fetch Trigger:** `LOAD_ENCOUNTER_IN_DISPLAY` postMessage -> `handleMessage` -> `transitionToView` -> `fetchAndPrepareEncounter`.
    - **API Call:** `axios.get(\`/api/encounters/GetEncounterData/\${encounterIdToLoad}\`, config)` within `fetchAndPrepareEncounter`.
    - **Auxiliary Fetches:** `verifyImagesLoadedForSlide` fetches user data for 'end' screen (`/api/user/by-sub/:sub`, `/api/users/:id`).
    - **No Data in `postMessage`:** `LOAD_ENCOUNTER_IN_DISPLAY` only sends `encounterId`. Data is always fetched by `PresentationDisplayHost`.
    - **Caching:** `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` writes to `encounterCacheRef`. `EncounterDisplay` child reads from this cache via `initialEncounterData` prop. `getEncounterDataCached` is a more robust cache utility but not directly used in the primary fetch path from `postMessage`.
    - **Duplicate Fetch Guards:** Checks exist in `handleMessage` and `transitionToView` using `currentEncounterRef.current`, `currentView` (state), and `isTransitioning`. Effectiveness is questionable due to state update timing, ref usage, and `isTransitioning` bypass.
    - **Problem Summary for Data Fetching:** The component assumes it must always fetch data upon receiving an `encounterId` via `postMessage`. The existing caching and duplicate checks might not be robust enough, especially under rapid message scenarios or during transitions.

### step-03: Analyze `postMessage` Listener Implementation **DONE**
- **Goal:** Understand how `PresentationDisplayHost.js` handles incoming `postMessage` events and identify potential issues with listener lifecycle or message processing.
- **Files to Review:** `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`.
- **Activities:**
    - Examine the `useEffect` hook responsible for adding and cleaning up the `postMessage` listener.
    - Verify the dependency array for this effect to understand when the listener is re-initialized (correlate with "Cleaned up postMessage listener" and "Initialized and listening..." logs).
    - Review the message handling logic: how different message types are parsed, how state is updated based on messages, and any guards against redundant processing.
    - Trace the cause of repeated listener cleanup and re-initialization observed in logs.
- **Est. time:** 1 h - 1.5 h
- **Output:** Detailed notes for `/cursornotes/02_M2.md` (`postMessage` Handling Analysis section), including findings on listener lifecycle and message processing logic.
- **Findings (Recorded from analysis):**
    - **Core Issue: Listener Lifecycle:** The `useEffect` for the `postMessage` listener has `[gameId, currentView, isTransitioning]` as dependencies. Changes to `currentView` and `isTransitioning` (which occur normally during message processing and transitions) cause the listener to be constantly removed and re-added. This is the primary source of the "cleanup/initialized" log spam and is inefficient.
    - **Consequences of Re-initialization:** Minor performance overhead, theoretical risk of missed messages, and increased code flow complexity.
    - **Stale Closure Mitigation:** `currentEncounterRef` and `gameIdRef` are updated at the start of `handleMessage` to provide the handler logic with more current values from state. However, the re-creation of `handleMessage` itself (due to the effect re-running) is the more significant factor.
    - **Message Handling Logic:**
        - Origin check is commented out (security concern for production).
        - `gameId` check (comparing message `gameId` with component's `gameIdRef.current`) is good.
        - Type-based `switch` statement is clear.
        - Duplicate `LOAD_ENCOUNTER_IN_DISPLAY` check: `if ( data.encounterId === currentEncounterRef.current && currentView === 'encounter' && !isTransitioning )`. This check is bypassed if `isTransitioning` is true, which could lead to re-processing and re-fetching for the same encounter if a message arrives mid-transition.
    - **State Updates Triggering Effect:** State updates within `handleMessage` (e.g., `setCurrentEncounterId`, `setPresenterHostSub`) directly contribute to the re-running of the listener effect due to `currentView` (often changed by `transitionToView` called from `handleMessage`) and `isTransitioning` being in its dependency array.
    - **Ideal Listener Lifecycle:** A global listener like this should ideally be set up once on mount and cleaned up on unmount, with a more stable dependency array (e.g., `[]` or `[gameId]`, if `handleMessage` can be structured appropriately).

### step-03.5: Review of Desired Flow and Insights from Single-Player Mode **DONE**
- **Goal:** Document the user's articulated desired operational flow for `PresentationDisplayHost` and capture learnings from the single-player `StoryView.js` component to inform the optimization plan.
- **Activities:**
    - Discussed and reviewed the user's 7-point ideal transition and data loading flow.
    - Analyzed `client/src/components/StoryView.js` for its data fetching and state management patterns.
- **Key Points from User's Desired Flow (Summary):**
    1.  **Component Structure:** Welcome, Encounter, Exit views (current design is fine).
    2.  **Welcome Window:** On new session with QR code (current design is fine).
    3.  **Educator Command:** `postMessage` to load encounter (current mechanism is fine).
    4.  **Display Receives Command -> One-Time DB Call:** Critical point. Fetch data for encounter ID (e.g., via API like `GetEncounterDetails/:id`). Skip if ID is already loaded. *This needs to be made robust in `PresentationDisplayHost`.*
    5.  **Display Receives Data -> Updates Screen:** Standard React flow.
    6.  **Display Ready for Next Command:** Natural outcome of stable listener and optimized fetching.
    7.  **Session End -> Final Slide:** Current mechanism is fine.
- **Key Learnings & Patterns from `client/src/components/StoryView.js`:**
    - **Centralized Logic via `EncounterContext`:** `StoryView.js` heavily relies on `useEncounter()` (approx. line 24-33 in `StoryView.js`) from `../contexts/EncounterContext.js`. This context manages:
        - Current encounter data (`currentEncounter`), routes (`encounterRoutes`), loading (`loading`), and error (`error`) states.
        - Fetching initial scenario data: `fetchEncounterData(scenarioId)` (e.g., called in `handleScenarioChange`, approx. line 104 in `StoryView.js`).
        - Fetching subsequent encounter data: `handleRouteSelection(routeId)` (e.g., called in `handleSelectRoute`, approx. line 185 in `StoryView.js`).
        - History management (`resetHistory`, `goBack`, `canGoBack`).
    - **Delegation of API Calls & Caching:** The component delegates actual API calls and caching logic to the `EncounterContext`. This is a clean separation of concerns and the pattern `PresentationDisplayHost` should adopt.
    - **Data Fetching Triggers in `StoryView.js`:**
        - Initial scenario load: `fetchEncounterData(parseInt(scenarioId, 10))` (approx. line 104 in `StoryView.js`).
        - Subsequent encounter choice: `contextHandleRouteSelection(routeId)` (approx. line 185 in `StoryView.js`, where `contextHandleRouteSelection` is destructured from `useEncounter()`).
        - **Robust Transition Logic:** `StoryView.js` demonstrates a good sequence for transitions:
            1.  Initiate data fetch (e.g., `contextHandleRouteSelection` approx. line 185 in `StoryView.js`).
            2.  Set a flag like `initiatingTransition` (approx. line 186 in `StoryView.js`).
            3.  Preload images for the new encounter (`preloadEncounterImages` function, approx. lines 110-171, and its usage in `useEffect` on approx. lines 174-178 in `StoryView.js`).
            4.  A `useEffect` (approx. lines 200-205 in `StoryView.js`) waits for `currentEncounter` (new data from context) AND `imagesLoaded` to be true before starting the visual transition (`setIsTransitioning(true)`).
            5.  The visual transition then proceeds (e.g., showing `previousEncounter` fading out, approx. lines 218-223 in `StoryView.js`).
        - **Implication for `PresentationDisplayHost`:** `PresentationDisplayHost` should be refactored to use a similar context-based or service-based approach for data fetching. Its direct `axios.get` in `fetchAndPrepareEncounter` and manual caching via `encounterCacheRef.current` should be replaced or augmented by this centralized logic, which already appears to exist in `EncounterContext`. This will likely address the multiple fetch issue and simplify state management.

### step-04: Analyze Component Re-Renders and Lifecycle Issues **DONE**
- **Goal:** Identify causes of potentially unnecessary re-renders or remounts of `PresentationDisplayHost.js`.
- **Files to Review:** `client/src/components/PresentationDisplayHost.js`, `client/src/App.js` (specifically the routing part for `/presentation-display`).
- **Activities:**
    - Review how `PresentationDisplayHost` is rendered in `App.js`. Could the routing setup cause remounts?
    - Identify state updates that might trigger cascading re-renders.
    - Consider if React.memo or other memoization techniques might be applicable once state flow is optimized.
- **Est. time:** 30 - 45 min
- **Output:** Notes for `/cursornotes/02_M2.md` (Component Lifecycle & Re-render Analysis section).
- **Findings (Recorded from analysis):**
    - **Routing in `App.js` (`client/src/App.js` line 228):**
        - `PresentationDisplayHost` is rendered via `<Route path="/presentation-display" element={<PresentationDisplayHost />} />`.
        - This route is *outside* the main `<EncounterProvider>` (lines 234-240 in `App.js`), meaning `PresentationDisplayHost` does not automatically share the same `EncounterContext` instance used by `StoryView.js`.
        - The direct routing setup is standard and does not inherently cause remounts of `PresentationDisplayHost` as long as the URL remains `/presentation-display`. It will mount on navigation to the path and unmount on navigation away, which is expected.
    - **Primary Locus of Re-Renders/Inefficiency:** Issues are internal to `PresentationDisplayHost.js`:
        - The `postMessage` listener's `useEffect` hook frequently re-runs due to its dependency array: `[gameId, currentView, isTransitioning]`. Changes to `currentView` and `isTransitioning` (common during operation) trigger effect cleanup and re-initialization.
        - Internal state updates (`setCurrentView`, `setIsTransitioning`, `setCurrentEncounterId`, etc.) trigger re-renders. The optimization focus should be on ensuring these updates are necessary and efficient.
    - **Applicability of `React.memo`:**
        - Not directly beneficial for `PresentationDisplayHost` itself at this stage, as it receives no props from its rendering `<Route>` in `App.js`. Its behavior is driven by URL params and `postMessage` events.
        - May be useful for child components rendered by `PresentationDisplayHost` once its internal logic is streamlined.
    - **Contextual Data Handling Confirmation:** The isolation from the main `EncounterProvider` reinforces the need for `PresentationDisplayHost` to have its own robust mechanism for fetching, caching, and managing encounter data, ideally inspired by the `EncounterContext` pattern observed in `StoryView.js`.

### step-05: Draft `/cursornotes/02_M2.md` **DONE**
- **Goal:** Consolidate all findings from steps 01-04 into a comprehensive technical plan document.
- **Files to Create:** `/cursornotes/02_M2.md`
- **Activities:**
    - Structure the document with sections for:
        - Problem Summary (reiterate from SOW M1 goal)
